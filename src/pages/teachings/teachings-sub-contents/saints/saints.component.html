    <h2>Saint Lorenzo Ruiz</h2>
    <p>
      was born around the year 1600 in Binondo, Manila in the Philippines. <br>
      He was the son of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother. <br>
      Both were Christians and took care to raise Lorenzo as a Catholic. <br>
      He served happily in his parish church as an altar boy and calligrapher.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>As a young man, Lorenzo joined the Dominican Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary.</p>
    
    <p>
      Later, he married a woman named Rosario. <br>
      The happy couple had three children,<br> 
      two sons and one daughter.<br>
      By all accounts, the family was ordinary and happy.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In 1636, Lorenzo was accused of murder. <br>
        Allegedly he killed a Spaniard. <br>
        However, to protect his safety at the time,<br> 
        he fled home and found refuge on board a ship with three Dominican priests and a leper. <br>
        There are no details of this alleged crime other than a journal entry by two Dominican priests, <br>
        that he joined their group to escape possible arrest.<br>
        The ship departed the Philippines on June 10, 1636, bound for Okinawa.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A shock awaited the holy passengers when they arrived in Japan. <br>
        At the time of their arrival, the rulers of Japan, <br>
        the Tokugawa Shogunate, were persecuting Christians. <br>
        Prior to this persecution, <br>
        the Christian population of Japan was thought to number 50,000 souls.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Now Lorenzo was arrested by Japanese officials <br>
        for the crime of being a Christian <br>
        and ordered to recant his faith.<br>
        When he refused he was imprisoned for two years.<br>
        On September 27, 1637, Lorenzo and his companions <br>
        were taken to Nagasaki to be tortured and killed <br>
        if they would not recant their faith. <br>
        Lorenzo and his companions were tortured by water, <br>
        which was forced into their mouths and down their throats <br>
        and out their noses and ears. <br>
        Despite the painful torture, the men refused to do so.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Following this, Lorenzo was hanged upside down, <br>
        with a rope around his ankles.<br>
         This method of torture was known as tsurushi, or "gallows and pit." <br>
         The torture forces a person to be hanged upside down <br>
         with a gash cut in their forehead to prevent too much blood <br>
         from gathering in the head. <br>
         The gash also causes the victim to bleed to death <br>
         over an extended period of time.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Those who have survived the torture have said it is unbearable. <br>
        One hand is left free so the victim can offer an agreed symbol <br>
        that will represent their desire to recant their faith. <br>
        Those few who recant are spared and allowed to live. <br>
        But few people ever recanted, choosing instead to die for their faith.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lorenzo refused to recant. <br>
        According to the record of his death, <br>
        his last words were, "I am a Catholic and wholeheartedly do accept death for God. <br>
        Had I a thousand lives, all these to Him I shall offer. <br>
        Do with me as you please."<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        His traveling companions were all killed, <br>
        steadfast until the end. <br>
        Lorenzo was beatified by Pope John Paul II on February 18, 1981. <br>
        The beatification ceremony was held in the Philippines <br>
        making it the first beatification ceremony ever held outside the Vatican.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A miracle attributed to his intercession occurred in 1983.<br>
         A two-year-old girl, Alegria Policarpio, <br>
         suffering from hydrocephaly, <br>
         a condition she had since birth, <br>
         was miraculously cured.<br>
         His canonization took place at the Vatican on October 18, 1987.<br>
         Saint Lorenzo Ruiz is the patron saint of Filipino youth, <br>
         the Philippines, people working overseas, and altar servers.  <br><br>
         (From: Catholic.org)<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>His feast day is September 28.</p>

    <h2>Saint Pedro Calungsod</h2>
    
    <p>
        is a Filipino Roman Catholic martyr who was killed <br>
        while doing missionary work in Guam in 1672. <br>
        He was beatified on March 5, 2000, by Pope John Paul II.<br>
         As a skilled sacristan and teacher of cathecism, <br>
         he was a companion of Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores to the Marianas Islands.<br> 
         Through their efforts, many receive the sacraments especially that of baptism. <br>
         A plot to kill Pedro and San Vitores started when a certain Choco, <br>
         a Chinese who gained influence over the Macanas of Marianas Island, <br>
         circulated false accusations that the missionaries <br>
         were spreading poison through the ritual of the pouring of water <br>
         (i.e. baptism), and through the ritual of Catholic Masses. <br><br>
         
         Calungsod and Diego San Vitores were both murdered <br>
         after baptizing an infant and mother who converted to the Roman Catholic faith. <br><br>
