    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <b>1. Why do we need a Church?</b>
    <p>By logic, as Christians we are to fulfill the “law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2). Christ has established his Church upon Peter the Rock (Matthew 16:18). The Holy Spirit speaks through the Church, as our mother and teacher, gives us official teachings. “It has been decided by the Holy Spirit and by us not to saddle you with any burden beyond these essentials” (Acts 15:28)</p>
    <p>If we are really Christians, why should we not seek membership in the Church whom Christ our Lord himself has founded?</p>

    <b>2. Is it true that outside the Church there is no salvation?</b>
    <p>This phrase refers to those who know Christ and his Church but doesn’t want to enter or persevere in it and does not necessarily mean those who are non-Catholics won’t be saved. Of course, if a person who haven’t heard of Christ, if he or she acts according to conscience and lived a righteous life, the person can be saved. “They demonstrate that God's law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right.” (Romans 2:15 NLT)</p>

    <b>3. The bible forbids the making of images (Exodus 20:3-4), why are there images, statues and pictures among Catholic churches?</b>
    <p>Answered by Mr. Michael Vincent Suico, President of Catholic Faith Defenders, Metro Manila:</p>
    <p>Are Catholics guilty of idolatry in using images, statues, and pictures of Jesus, Mary, and the saints by placing them in Churches and in their homes according to Exodus 20:3-4? many would probably say, “Yes!” because they understood these verses as absolute prohibition of making and using images for religious purposes.</p>
    <p>First, let us differentiate image (icon) from idols. Image is a representation of something in God’s creation (e.g. humans, animals, sun, angels, et al.) whereas an Idol is a representation of something in God’s creation AND worshiped as a god. It is very clear that the difference is based on the purpose. Catholics, contrary to baseless accusation of protestants, do not believe that an image is worthy of adoration which belongs to God alone (CCC 2132).  Now, in Exodus 20:3-4 it is clear that what is prohibited is the making of images with the purpose of worshiping it as God or a god. There are instances in the bible when God commanded the making of images such as cherubim (Ex. 25:18-20), palms, pomegranates (1Kings 7:25), bronze serpent (Numbers 21:8-9), oxen (1Kings 7:25), and lions (1 Kings 7:29).</p>
    <p>If anti-Catholics were correct, then God would have committed a mistake when he commanded his people to make such images. But this is against the nature of God who cannot err (Heb. 6:18).</p>
  
    <b>4. Jesus said do not call anyone “father” on earth (Matthew 23:9) why do Catholics call their priests fathers?</b>
    <p>We shouldn’t be misled by the interpretations of anti-Catholics here. Matthew 23:7-10 simply tells us not to give honor to a man what is due to God, in fact, it also forbids calling anyone “Teacher” (v.8), does it mean we should not call our teacher or professor by their titles?</p>
    <p>The Apostle Paul refers to himself as a spiritual father (1 Corinthians 4:15) The Prophets were treated like fathers (2 Kings 2:12, 6:21).</p>
  
    <b>5. Do Catholics worship Mary and the Saints?</b>
    <p>Answered by Ms. Minnie Abigail Agdeppa, OCDS </p>
    <p>No! Catholics ask the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Saints for help in their petitions or to help them grow in holiness like them. As we normally do in the family, we ask our mother to bridge us to our father in the approval of our requests to him. In the Blessed Virgin Mary's case, she brings forth our petitions before her Son who then brings them to the Father for approval--since Jesus, as He Himself said, is the only one who can come to the Father. The Saints act in a similar way since they are already in the company of God. The only difference is that the Saints bring our petitions to Our Lady who then presents it to Her Son. After all Mary is the Mediatrix of Grace, for she is full of Grace, and mediator of the human race. The Biblical basis for this is during the Passion of Christ when at the Cross, Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us His Mother, thereby giving her the important role to of taking care of our needs. We revere the Blessed Mother and the Saints who serve as role models in our journey here on earth towards everlasting life with God.</p>
  
    <b>6. Is Purgatory real?</b>
    <p>Purgatory is a state of purification. Fundamentalists say that it isn’t the bible, however they failed to answer where the souls of imperfect but just men will go. Hell is an eternal damnation or eternal separation from God (Matthew 25:41) while Heaven is a state of perfect communion with God with Mary, the Angels and the Saints (Rev. 22:3-5)</p>
    <p>So where will the souls go if they did not die in the state of mortal sin? But are not yet in the state of perfect communion with God? This is what we call Purgatory, we can recall in the Bible that Jesus once said, “you surely won't be free again until you have paid the last penny” (Matthew 5:25)</p>
  
    <b>7. Is Peter the first Pope?</b>
    <p>The Pope is the visible head of the Universal Church. We know that Peter is the first Pope for it was Christ himself who appointed Peter to lead His Church, “You are Peter (rock) and upon this rock, I will build my Church” (Matthew 16:18). Furthermore, we can see other verses where Christ reaffirms Peter’s leadership among his flock (John 21:17)</p>
    <p>Peter, being the first leader of the Church presides over the Christians in Rome as their Bishop, therefore, logic will attests that those who succeed Peter as Bishop of Rome are his legitimate successors. History proves an unbroken line of succession of the bishopric of Rome from Peter to our current Pope, Francis.</p>
  
    <b>8. Did Peter went to Rome?</b>
    <p>Fundamentalists try to argue that Peter never went to Rome because the bible never mentioned his Roman residency explicitly. However, we can read that Peter was writing his letter from Babylon (1 Peter 5:13). As early Christians understand it, Babylon was a code name for Rome. Early Church historians and Christians of the first five centuries like Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius etc., all wrote that Peter indeed went to Rome and presided over the Church there and was martyred under Emperor Nero.</p>
    <p>Archeological findings also prove Peter’s bones beneath St. Peter’s Basilica were scientifically and historically confirmed to be of Peter the Apostle.</p>

    <b>9. Why Mary called the Immaculate Conception?</b>
    <p>Catholics believe that Mary is immaculately conceived; meaning to say that she was preserved from the stain of original sin from the moment of her conception and has lived a sinless life. Though we cannot find explicitly in the bible about the Immaculate Conception, we can read it implicitly when the angel greeted her, “Hail! Full of Grace! The Lord is with You!” ((Luke 1:28). The Greek term originally used for “Full of Grace” is Kecharitomene, it is the perfect present participle of Charitoo (Grace), which means, Mary is perfectly graced in the past and is continuously graced in the present. </p>
    <p>Grace is opposed to Sin, the Apostle Paul said, “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14). If sin has no dominion over persons who are under grace, how can sin dominate Mary who is perfectly graced? </p>

    <b>10. If Mary is a virgin, why does Jesus have brothers and sisters? (Mark 6:3)</b>
    <p>Mark 6:3 is often used by Fundamentalists to prove that Mary did not preserve in her state of virginity because it mentions of Jesus’ other brothers such as James and John. However, we have to understand that in Aramaic, the original language of Jesus, there is no word for cousin. If we scrutinize the bible, we can have an understanding that the James, Joses, Simon and Jude mentioned were the same characters who are identified as children of ‘another’ Mary (Mark 15:40) and this is the Blessed Virgin Mary’s sister, who is the wife of Cleophas (John 19:25)</p>
    <p>Here we understand the culture of Jesus’ society, we can read that Abraham even called his nephew Lot as brother, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers” (Genesis 13:8). </p>
