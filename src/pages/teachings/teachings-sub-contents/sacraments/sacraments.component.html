    <h2>Introduction to Sacraments</h2>
    <p>The Sacraments are invisible signs of the invisible grace which were Instituted by Christ</p>
    <p>Is there some inner logic that unites the sacraments with each other?</p>
    <p>All SACRAMENTS are an encounter with Christ, who is himself the original sacrament. 
      There are sacraments of INITIATION, which introduce the recipient into the faith: Baptism, CONFIRMATION and EUCHARIST. 
      There are sacraments of healing: Reconciliation and the Anointing of the Sick. And there are sacraments of communion and mission: 
      Matrimony and Holy Orders. [1210-1211]</p>
    <p>Baptism joins us with Christ. Confirmation gives us his Spirit. The Eucharist unites us with him. Confession reconciles us with Christ. 
      Through the Anointing of the Sick, Christ heals, strengthens, and consoles. In the sacrament of Matrimony, 
      Christ promises his love in our love and his fidelity in our fidelity. Through the sacrament of Holy Orders, 
      PRIESTS have the privilege of forgiving sins and celebrating the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. </p>

    <h2>Sacramentals</h2>
    <p>Sacramentals are different from the Sacraments. The Sacraments were instituted by Christ, while Sacramentals were instituted by the Church.</p>
    <p>“Sacramentals are sacred signs or sacred actions in which a blessing is conferred. 
      [1667-1672,1677-1678] examples of sacramentals are holy water, the consecration of a bell or an organ, 
      the blessing of a house or an automobile, the blessing of throats on the feast of St. Blaise, receiving ashes on Ash Wednesday, 
      palm branches on Palm Sunday, the Easter candle, and the blessing of produce on the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.” <b>(Youth Catechism 272)</b></p>

    <h2>The Sacrament of Baptism</h2>
    <p>BAPTISM IS the way out of the kingdom of death into life, the gateway to the CHURCH and the beginning of a lasting communion with God. [1213-1216,1276-1278]</p>
    <p>BAPTISM is the foundational SACRAMENT and the prerequisite for all other sacraments. It unites us with Jesus Christ, 
      incorporates us into his redemptive death on the Cross, thereby freeing us from the power of Original Sin and all personal sins, 
      and causes us to rise with him to a life without end. Since Baptism is a covenant with God, the individual must say Yes to it. 
      In the Baptism of children, the parents confess the Faith on behalf of the children. <b>(Youth Catechism 194)</b></p>

    <h2>The Sacrament of Confirmation</h2>
    <p>CONFIRMATION is the SACRAMENT that completes BAPTISM’ it it the gift of the Holy Spirit is bestowed upon us. 
      Anyone who freely decides to live a life as God’s child and asks for God’s Spirit under the signs of the imposition of hands and anointing with 
      – CHRISM receives the strength to witnesses to God’s love and might in word and deed. 
      He is now a full - fledged, responsible member of the Catholic – CHURCH. [1285-1314]</p>
    <p>When a coach sends a soccer player onto the playing field, he puts his hand in his shoulder and gives him final instructions. 
      We can understand Confirmation in a similar way. A hand is placed upon us. We step out onto the field of life. 
      Through the Holy Spirit we know what we have to do and we have been given the power to do it. He has motivated us. 
      We will not betray his trust or disappoint him; we will win the game for him. We just have to want to do it and listen to him. <b>(Youth Catechism 203)</b></p>

    <h2>The Sacrament of the Eucharist</h2>
    <p>HOLY EUCHARIST is the SACRAMENT in which Jesus Christ gives his Body and Blood -  himself – 
      for us, so that we too might give ourselves to him in love and be united with him in Holy – 
      COMMUNION. In this way we are joined with the one Body of Christ, the – CHURCH. [1322, 1324, 1409, 1413]</p>
    <p>After Baptism and – CONFIRMATION, the Eucharist is the third sacrament initiation of the Catholic Church. 
      The Eucharist is the mysterious center of all these sacraments, because the historic sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross is made 
      present during the words of consecration in a hidden, unbloody, manner. Thus the celebration of the Eucharist is 
      “the source and summit of the Christian life” (Second VATICAN Council, Lumen Gentium [LG], 11).</p>
    <p>Everything aims at this; besides this there is nothing greater that one could attain. When we eat the broken Bread, 
      we united ourselves with the Love of Jesus, who gave his body for us on the wood of the Cross; 
      when we drink from the chalice, we unite ourselves with him who even poured out his blood out of love for us. We did not invent this ritual. 
      Jesus himself celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples and therein anticipated his death; 
      he gave himself to his disciples under the signs of bread and wine and commanded them from then on, even after his death, 
      to celebrated the EUCHARIST. “Do this in remembrance of me” ( 1 Cor 11:24). <b>(Youth Catechism 208)</b></p>

    <h2>The Sacrament of Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week," Jesus showed himself to his apostles. 
      "He breathed on them, and said to them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; 
      if you retain the sins of any, they are retained"' (Jn 20:19, (22-23).</p>
    <p>The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is conferred by a particular sacrament called the sacrament of conversion, 
      confession, penance, or reconciliation.</p>
    <p>The sinner wounds God's honor and love, his own human dignity as a man called to be a son of God, 
      and the spiritual well-being of the Church, of which each Christian ought to be a living stone.</p>
    <p>To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and nothing has worse consequences for sinners themselves, 
      for the Church, and for the whole world.</p>
    <p>To return to communion with God after having lost it through sin is a process born of the grace of God who is rich in mercy and solicitous 
      for the salvation of men. One must ask for this precious gift for oneself and for others.</p>
    <p>The movement of return to God, called conversion and repentance, entails sorrow for and abhorrence of sins committed,
       and the firm purpose of sinning no more in the future. 
       Conversion touches the past and the future and is nourished by hope in God's mercy.</p>
    <p>The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in three actions of the penitent and the priest's absolution. 
      the penitent's acts are repentance, confession or disclosure of sins to the priest, 
      and the intention to make reparation and do works of reparation.</p>
    <p>Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by motives that arise from faith. 
      If repentance arises from love of charity for God, it is called "perfect" contrition; if it is founded on other motives, 
      it is called "imperfect."</p>
    <p>One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed 
      grave sins he remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. the confession of venial faults, 
      without being necessary in itself, is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.</p>
    <p>The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of "satisfaction" or "penance" to be performed by 
      the penitent in order to repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits befitting a disciple of Christ.</p>
    <p>Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the authority of the Church can forgive sins in the name of Christ.</p>

    <h2>The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick</h2>
    <p>"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, 
      anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up;
       and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven" (Jas 5:14-15).</p>
    <p>The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its purpose the conferral of a special grace on the Christian experiencing 
      the difficulties inherent in the condition of grave illness or old age</p>
    <p>The proper time for receiving this holy anointing has certainly arrived when the believer begins to be in danger of death because of illness or old age.</p>
    <p>Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive the Anointing of the Sick, and also when, after he has received it, the illness worsens.</p>
    <p>Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, using oil blessed by the bishop, or if necessary by the celebrating presbyter himself.</p>
    <p>The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists essentially in the anointing of the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the Roman Rite) or of other parts of the body (in the Eastern rite), the anointing being accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant asking for the special grace of this sacrament.</p>
    <b>The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of Penance; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the preparation for passing over to eternal life.</p>
      </li>

  <h2>The Sacrament of Matrimony</h2>
  <p>St. Paul said: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church.... This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church" (Eph 5:25,  32).</p>
  <p>The marriage covenant, by which a man and a woman form with each other an intimate communion of life and love, has been founded and endowed with its own special laws by the Creator. By its very nature it is ordered to the good of the couple, as well as to the generation and education of children. Christ the Lord raised marriage between the baptized to the dignity of a sacrament (cf  CIC, can. 1055 # 1; cf. GS 48 # 1).</p>
  <p>The sacrament of Matrimony signifies the union of Christ and the Church. It gives spouses the grace to love each other with the love with which Christ has loved his Church; the grace of the sacrament thus perfects the human love of the spouses, strengthens their indissoluble unity, and sanctifies them on the way to eternal life (cf Council of Trent: DS 1799).</p>
  <p>Marriage is based on the consent of the contracting parties, that is, on their will to give themselves, each to the other, mutually and definitively, in order to live a covenant of faithful and fruitful love.</p>
  <p>Since marriage establishes the couple in a public state of life in the Church, it is fitting that its celebration be public, in the framework of a liturgical celebration, before the priest (or a witness authorized by the Church), the witnesses, and the assembly of the faithful.</p>
  <p>Unity, indissolubility, and openness to fertility are essential to marriage. Polygamy is incompatible with the unity of marriage; divorce separates what God has joined together; the refusal of fertility turns married life away from its "supreme gift," the child (GS 50 # 1).</p>
  <p>The remarriage of persons divorced from a living, lawful spouse contravenes the plan and law of God as taught by Christ. They are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic communion. They will lead Christian lives especially by educating their children in the faith.</p>
  <p>The Christian home is the place where children receive the first proclamation of the faith. For this reason the family home is rightly called "the domestic church," a community of grace and prayer, a school of human virtues and of Christian charity.</p>

  <h2>The Sacrament of Holy Orders</h2>
  <p>St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: "I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands" (2Tim 1:6), and "If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task." (1 Tim 3:1) To Titus he said: "This is why I left you in Crete, that you amend what was defective, and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you" (Titus 1:5).</p>
  <p>The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Baptism all the faithful share in the priesthood of Christ. This participation is called the "common priesthood of the faithful." Based on this common priesthood and ordered to its service, there exists another participation in the mission of Christ: the ministry conferred by the sacrament of Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the name and in the person of Christ the Head in the midst of the community.</p>
  <p>The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the common priesthood of the faithful because it confers a sacred power for the service of the faithful. the ordained ministers exercise their service for the People of God by teaching (munus docendi), divine worship (munus liturgicum) and pastoral governance (munus regendi).</p>
  <p>Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been conferred and exercised in three degrees: that of bishops, that of presbyters, and that of deacons. the ministries conferred by ordination are irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without the bishop, presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the Church (cf St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trall. 3,1).</p>
  <p>The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders, which integrates him into the episcopal college and makes him the visible head of the particular Church entrusted to him. As successors of the apostles and members of the college, the bishops share in the apostolic responsibility and mission of the whole Church under the authority of the Pope, successor of St. Peter.</p>
  <p>Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at the same time depend on them in the exercise of their pastoral functions; they are called to be the bishops' prudent co-workers. They form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears responsibility with him for the particular Church. They receive from the bishop the charge of a parish community or a determinate ecclesial office.</p>
  <p>Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of the Church; they do not receive the ministerial priesthood, but ordination confers on them important functions in the ministry of the word, divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks which they must carry out under the pastoral authority of their bishop.</p>
  <p>The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of hands followed by a solemn prayer of consecration asking God to grant the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit required for his ministry. Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental character.</p>
  <p>The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only on baptized men (viri), whose suitability for the exercise of the ministry has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has the responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders.</p>
  <p>In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the presbyterate is normally conferred only on candidates who are ready to embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest their intention of staying celibate for the love of God's kingdom and the service of men.</p>
  <p>It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders in the three degrees.</p>
