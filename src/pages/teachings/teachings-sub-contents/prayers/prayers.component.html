  <h2>Prayer in the Christian Life</h2>
  <h3>What is Prayer</h3>
  <p>For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; 
    <br>it is a simple look turned toward heaven, 
    <br>it is a cry of recognition and of love, 
    <br>embracing both trial and joy
  </p>

  <h3>Prayer as God's Gift</h3>
  <p>"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God."  
    <br>But when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, or "out of the depths" of a humble and contrite heart?
    <br>He who humbles himself will be exalted; humility is the foundation of prayer,
    <br>Only when we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray as we ought," are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. 
    <br>"Man is a beggar before God."</p>

  <p>"If you knew the gift of God!"
    <br>The wonder of prayer is revealed beside the well where we come seeking water: there, Christ comes to meet every human being. 
    <br>It is he who first seeks us and asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his asking arises from the depths of God's desire for us.
    <br>Whether we realize it or not, prayer is the encounter of God's thirst with ours. God thirsts that we may thirst for him.</p>

  <p>"You would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
    <br>Paradoxically our prayer of petition is a response to the plea of the living God: 
    <br>"They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water!"
    <br>Prayer is the response of faith to the free promise of salvation and also a response of love to the thirst of the only Son of God.</p>

  <h3>Prayer as Covenant</h3>
  <p>Where does prayer come from? 
    <br>Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man who prays. 
    <br>But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand times). 
    <br>According to Scripture, it is the heart that prays. 
    <br>If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain.</p>

  <p>The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live; according to the Semitic or Biblical expression, the heart is the place "to which I withdraw." 
    <br>The heart is our hidden center, beyond the grasp of our reason and of others; 
    <br>only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it fully. 
    <br>The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives. 
    <br>It is the place of truth, where we choose life or death. 
    <br>It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in relation: 
    <br>it is the place of covenant.</p>

  <p>Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and man in Christ. 
    <br>It is the action of God and of man, springing forth from both the Holy Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to the Father, in union with the human will of the Son of God made man.</p>

  <h3>Prayer as Communion</h3>
  <p>In the New Covenant, prayer is the living relationship of the children of God with their Father who is good beyond measure, with his Son Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>The grace of the Kingdom is "the union of the entire holy and royal Trinity . . . with the whole human spirit.”
    <br>Thus, the life of prayer is the habit of being in the presence of the thrice-holy God and in communion with him. 
    <br>This communion of life is always possible because, through Baptism, we have already been united with Christ.
    <br>Prayer is Christian insofar as it is communion with Christ and extends throughout the Church, which is his Body. Its dimensions are those of Christ's love.</p>

  <h3>Preparatory Prayers</h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, our adorable Saviour, 
    we now contemplate Your sacred passion. 
    Help us to understand that the sufferings

    Amen.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 1 – Jesus is condemned to death</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leaving the house of Caiaphas, where he 
    had been blasphemed, and the house of Herod, 
    where he had been been mocked, 
    Jesus is dragged before Pilate, 
    his back torn with scourges, 
    his head crowned with thorns; 
    and he, who on the last day 
    will judge the living and the dead, 
    is himself condemned to a disgraceful death.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    It was for us that You did suffer, 
    O Blessed Jesus. It was for our sins 
    that You were condemned to die. 
    Oh, grant that we may detest our sins 
    from the bottom of our hearts, 
    and obtain your mercy 
    and pardon by repentance.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3>

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>
 

  <h3>Station 2 – Jesus is laden with the Cross</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>
       
  <p>
    A heavy cross is laid upon the bruised shoulders of Jesus. 
    He receives it with meekness and with a sense of commitment, 
    for it is the instrument with which 
    he is to redeem the world and 
    to accomplish the mission 
    for which his heavenly Father has sent him.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, grant us, by virtue of your cross, 
    to embrace with meekness and cheerful submission 
    the difficulties of our life, 
    and to be ever ready to take up our cross and follow You.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3> 

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 3 – Jesus falls for the first time</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bowed down under the weight of the cross, 
    Jesus slowly sets forth on the way to Calvary,
    amidst the mockeries and insults of the crowd. 
    His agony in the garden has exhausted his body. 
    He is lacerated with blows and wounds; 
    his strength fails Him. He falls to the ground under his cross.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, who for our sins did bear 
    the heavy burden of the cross 
    and did fall under its weight, 
    may the thoughts of your suffering 
    make us watchful over ourselves 
    and save us from any grievous fall into sin.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3>

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 4 – Jesus meets his Blessed Mother</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still burdened with his cross, 
    and wounded yet more by his fall, 
    Jesus proceeds on His way.
    He is met by his loving mother. 
    What a meeting must have that been! 
    What a sword of anguish 
    must have pierced the mother’s heart! 
    What must have been the 
    compassion of that Son for his holy mother!
    </p>

    <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, by the compassion which 
    You did feel for You Mother, 
    have compassion on us, 
    and give us a share in her intercession. 
    O Mary, most afflicted mother, 
    intercede for us that, 
    through the sufferings of your Son, 
    we may be delivered from eternal death.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3> 

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>


  <h3>Station 5 – Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry the cross</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the strength of Jesus fails, 
    and he is unable to proceed, 
    the executioners seize 
    and compel Simon of Cyrene to carry His cross. 
    The grace of that cross changes 
    the Cyrenean’s heart and from the compulsory task, 
    it becomes a privilege and joy.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Lord Jesus, may it be our privilege to bear our cross. 
    May we glory in nothing else; by the cross,
    may the world be crucified unto us, and we unto the world. 
    May we never shrink from suffering 
    but rather rejoice if we should be counted 
    worthy to suffer for your name’s sake.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3>

  <p>Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 6 – Veronica wipes the face of Jesus</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Jesus proceeds along the way covered 
    with the sweat of blood, a woman, 
    moved with compassion, 
    makes her way through the crowd, 
    and wipes his face with a handkerchief. 
    As a reward for her piety, 
    the impression of His sacred countenance 
    is miraculously imprinted upon the handkerchief.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, may the contemplation of 
    your sufferings move us with deep compassion. 
    Make us hate our sins and kindle in our hearts, 
    more fervent love for You. 
    May your image be graven on our minds 
    until we are transformed into Your likeness.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3>

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 7 – Jesus falls beneath His cross, the second time</h3>

  <p>Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pain of his wounds; 
    and the loss of blood increasing at every step of his way, 
    weakens him; 
    and Jesus falls to the ground for the second time.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, who did fall a second time 
    beneath the load of our sins 
    and of your suffering for our sins, 
    how often have we grieved you 
    by our repeated falls into sin! 
    Oh, may we rather die than ever offend You!
  </p>

  <h3>
      Our Father in Heaven<br>
      Hail Mary<br>
      Glory Be<br>
    </h3>

  <p>
    Leader: Have mercy on us, O Lord.<br>
    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 8 – Jesus consoles the women of Jerusalem</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the sight of the sufferings of Jesus,
    some holy women in the crowd were so touched 
    with sympathy that they openly bewailed 
    and lamented for Him. Jesus, 
    knowing the things that would befall Jerusalem 
    because of its rejection of him, 
    turned to them and said, 
    “Daughters of Jerusalem, 
    weep for yourselves and for your children”.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, we mourn and will always mourn 
    for you and for ourselves, 
    for your sufferings and for our sins which caused them. 
    Oh, teach us to mourn, so that we may repent 
    and be saved from the dreadful end 
    to those who reject or neglect you, 
    their God and their all.
  </p>

  <h3>

    All: Have mercy on us.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 9 – Jesus falls beneath His cross the third time</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus has almost arrived at the summit of Calvary, 
    but before he reaches the spot where he is to be crucified, 
    his strength again fails Him, 
    and he falls the third time.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>
  
  <p>
    O Jesus, we entreat you by the merit 
    of this your third and most painful fall,
    to pardon our frequent relapses 
    and our long continuance in sin. 
    May the thought of Your sufferings 
    make us hate our sins more and more.
  </p>

  <h3>

  <h3>Station 10 – Jesus is stripped of His garments</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jesus at last arrives at Golgotha 
    and they prepare to crucify Him. 
    They strip Him of His garments and mock Him.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, strip us of all false esteem, 
    conceit and pride and make us humble 
    like you in this life, 
    so that we share your glory 
    with you in the life to come.
  </p>

  <h3>Station 11 – Jesus is nailed to the cross</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.   
  </p>

  <p>
    The cross is laid upon the ground 
    and Jesus is stretched upon His bed of death. 
    With divine dignity and forgiveness, 
    he lets himself be nailed to the cross. 
    The blows are struck! The blood gushes forth!
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, nailed to the cross, 
    fasten our hearts to the cross, 
    so that we may be united with you 
    until we yield up our souls to you.

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    For three hours, Jesus has hung upon His pierced hands. 
    His blood has run in streams down his body, 
    and onto the ground. 
    In the midst of excruciating suffering, 
    he has pardoned his murderers, 
    given heaven to the good thief, 
    and committed his blessed mother 
    to his beloved disciple’s care. 
    His mission of love has been accomplished. 
    He bows his head and gives up his Spirit to God.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Jesus, we devoutly embrace your saving cross, 
    on which you died so that we may have eternal life. 
    We hail your cross, and lovingly accept our own.

  <h3>Station 13 – Jesus is taken down from the cross</h3>

  <p>
    Leader: We adore You, O Christ, and we bless You.<br>
    All: Because by Your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The multitudes have left the hill of Calvary. 
    There is no one except the beloved disciple of Jesus 
    and the holy women with Mary, the mother of Jesus. 
    Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus take down 
    the body of Jesus from the cross 
    and place him in the arms of his afflicted mother.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Prayer</i></h3>

  <p>
    O Mary, mother of Jesus, your grief was so great, 
    being a helpless witness to the savage way your Son was put to death. 
    By his death and resurrection, we have become your children in Jesus. 
    Help us by your intercession to be like your son Jesus.

    The disciples take the body of her dear beloved Son Jesus from his mother, 
    and place it in the tomb.
    The tomb is closed and in it the lifeless body remains 
    until the hour of its glorious resurrection.

  <p>
    Lord, your suffering is over. 
    You have triumphed, 
    though in the eyes of men, 
    you may seem to have failed. 
    Sin, death and hell have been conquered. 
    The world is Yours, I am Yours. 
    Be the King of my heart. 
    I surrender myself to your Holy Will. 
    May Your kingdom come.

  <p>
    Heavenly Father, we have contemplated your Son, 
    Jesus, on his Way of the Cross, 
    in his Spirit which you have gifted to us. 
    We accept our way of the cross. 
    We know it will lead us to, 
    where it led him to, 
    our resurrection with him. 
    We thank You for the joy of this vision of faith.

      Beneath the veil of the Host, show us the powerful and generous Christ of the Gospels;<br>
      Let us see the Good Shepherd who knows each one of us, watches over us and calls us by name;<br>

      Let us recognize this friend, happy to live with us and share our human existence;<br>
      Allow us to recognize the victim of Calvary who spares nothing of the gift of Himself to obtain for us pardon and holiness.<br>
      Give us a profound attachment to Jesus in the Eucharist; that his ardent desire to remain among us be met by our readiness to welcome Him.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
      L: Holy Virgin, you who knew how to look at Jesus and penetrate the most profound depth of his person:<br>
      Teach us to look at Him, to look at him at length and quietly, in the tabernacle where he is present.<br>
      Teach us to listen in silence to the words which he speaks to us and establish an intimate dialogue with him. <br>

      A: Let us see the marvels which he desires to work in the depths of our souls.<br>
      Teach us to appreciate his closeness to us and the immeasurable friendship he shows us.<br>
      Help us to respond to his love with all the fire of our being, and like you, to immerse ourselves in a loving gaze on him.<br>
  </p>

  <p>

      help us to revere this sacred mystery more in our daily life. <br>
      May we reflect and ponder on your great love for us that made you offer yourself<br>

<h3>Prayer of Protection Against Fires</h3>
<p>
  Almighty and eternal God, we ask Your protection against destroying fire. Fire is so very necessary for our existence, and yet, when it gets out of control, it can be more damaging than anything else. Keep our homes and buildings and woods and fields safe from this scourge. Help us always to be most careful in our use of it. Help us especially in the winter time when need and use it most. For then, if our homes are destroyed by fire, we suffer more than ever.
</p>

<p>
  Give us, too, we humbly pray You, a saving fear of the fires of passion, and the help of Your grace to control them. Help us also to fear the fires of hell, that we may always keep away from serious sin, and live lives of goodness and virtue, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Prayer for Peace and Protection from Violence and from Terrorism By: HH Pope Francis</h3>
<p>
    O Almighty and merciful God, Lord of the universe and of history. All that You have created is good and your compassion for the mistakes of mankind knows no limits. We come to You today to ask You to keep in peace the world and its people, to keep far away from it the devastating wave of terrorism, to restore friendship and instill in the hearts of your creatures the gift of trust and of readiness to forgive.
</p>
<p>
    O Giver of life, we pray to You also for all those who have died as victims of brutal terrorist attacks. Grant them their eternal reward. May they intercede for the world that is torn apart by conflicts and disagreements.
</p>

<p>
    O Jesus, Prince of Peace, we pray to You for the ones who have been wounded in these acts of inhuman violence: children and young people, old people and innocent people accidentally involved in evil. Heal their bodies and hearts; console them with Your strength and, at the same time, take away any hatred and a desire for revenge.
</p>

<p>
    Holy Spirit Consoler, visit the families of the victims of terrorism, families that suffer through no fault of their own. Wrap them in the mantle of Your divine mercy. Make them find again in You and in themselves the strength and courage to continue to be brothers and sisters for others, above all for immigrants, giving witness to Your love by their lives.
</p>

<p>
    Touch the hearts of terrorists so that they may recognize the evil of their actions and may turn to the way of peace and goodness, of respect for the life and for the dignity of every human being, regardless of religion, origin, wealth or poverty.
</p>

<p>
    O God, Eternal Father, in Your mercy hear our prayer which we raise up to You amidst the deafening noise and desperation of the world. We turn to You with great hope, full of trust in Your Infinite Mercy. Made strong by the examples of the blessed martyrs of Perú, Zbigniew and Michael, who have rendered courageous testimony to the Gospel, to the point of offering their blood, we entrust ourselves to the intercession of Your Most Holy Mother. We ask for the gift of peace and of the elimination from our midst of the sore of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
    Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Short Prayer Against Storms and Floods</h3>

Please infuse me even with just the tiniest spark of Your Divine Wisdom so that as I do my work, it is really your work that is done. Loving God, make my heart Your Heart, make my mind Your Mind, and make my hands Your Hands. Make me your instrument, so that I may be always conscious and mindful of the fact that on my work depend the lives and properties of my fellow human.

  <h3>Prayer for Firefighters</h3>

  <p>Dear God, through the intercession of our patron, Saint Florian, have mercy on the souls of our comrades who have made the supreme sacrifice in the performance of their duty, and on all who have gone before us after years of faithful discharge of their responsibilities which now rest on ourselves. Give us Grace to prepare each day for our own summons to Thy tribunal of justice. Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit. Withersoever Thou callest me, I am ready to go. Merciful Father of all men, save my from all bodily harm, if it be Thy will, but above all, help me to be loyal and true, respectful and honorable, obedient and valiant.

Star of the Sea, Mother of the Church, give light and strength to those chaplains and lay ministers who bring the love of your Divine Son among mariners.

may be delivered from present sorrow, <br>
and obtain eternal joy. <br>
Through Christ our Lord. <br><br>
Amen.
